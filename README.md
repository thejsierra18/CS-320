    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    
    To ensure that my code is functional and secure, I tested against the requirements and possible use cases. In this project we were given all the user needs ahead of time, which allowed me to code based on those needs, without having to worry about any sudden change. As I was developing my code, I tested each different component, ensuring that I had an appropiate coverage on each class, and that no input could break the program.
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    
    User needs lay out the functionality of the program, it does not state how is done, but what the goals are and what the program is expected to do. To incorporate user needs into a program, I referenced the requirements and ensure that as I was developing the code, nothing was missed. To do this, I tested against each requirement and compared the outputs to what was expected, ensuring a total functionality of the program. 
    
    How do I approach designing software?
    
    My approach to designing software is based on reusability, scalability and functionality. I always try to divide my program into components, reusing code that is repeated through the use of functions, and ensuring that as the program grows, each object still works the way it's supposed to. I ensure my program is functional by testing whenever changes are made, and refactoring the code in order to make it more readable.
